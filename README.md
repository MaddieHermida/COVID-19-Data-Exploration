# COVID-19-Data-Exploration
Data Exploration of COVID-19 project using MySQL Workbench

A data exploration project using MySQL Workbench querying a dataset provided in this link https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Skills used: Joins, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, CTEs, Data types conversion 

In this project, the dataset was divided into two .xlsx files: Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations which will then be imported to create 2 tables in our database/schema. The data exploration takes place into different MySQL queries such as below. I am emphasizing MySQL in this project as some functions differ if you try to do the same project from other versions of SQL languages.

•	Dataset check for Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations

•	Selection of data/columns to use

•	Checking out Total Cases vs Total Deaths

•	Checking out Total Cases vs Population

•	Highest Infection Rate per country

•	Highest Death Count per population

•	Highest Death Count per continent

•	Global Numbers

•	Looking at Total Population vs Vaccinations

•	Using CTE

•	Creating View to store data for later visualizations
